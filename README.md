# FES-E-Portfolio

**Building visual-first interfaces that turn real-world complexity into shared understanding.**

I create clean, creative digital products: dashboards, tools, interfaces, and experiments.

**Areas of Exploration:**  
- Visual decision surfaces  
- Real-world systems and workflows  
- Clarity over complexity  
- Creative interfaces with practical intent  

Across all products, interface types may change, principles do not:  
*clarity, focus, and trust.*
